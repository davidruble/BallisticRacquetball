# Ballistic Racquetball

**Ballistic Racquetball** is like a racquetball/pong hybrid in VR, but instead of a ball you throw around a grenade,
and instead of a racket to knock the grenade back and forth you use guns! Once the grenade starts moving there is a
timer that starts, and the player whose side the grenade is on when it detonates loses. The idea was inspired by the 
[Death Ping Pong scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyv30nT955g) from the movie *You Don't Mess With The Zohan*, 
as well as a conversation with my buddy Taylor Sloan.
